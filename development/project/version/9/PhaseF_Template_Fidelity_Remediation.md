# Version 9 — Phase F: Template Fidelity Remediation

**Status:** in progress
**Branch:** `claude/nice-ride-xSz7t`
**Source of truth:** `development/project/version/9/Digital Signal Intelligence - Revised.zip`
(extract to `/tmp/dsi-revised/`; templates live in `client_review/*.jsx` + `chrome.css` + `tokens.css` + `primitives.jsx`)

## Purpose
A full template-vs-implementation audit (5 parallel agents, May 2026) found the
frontend is **substantially faithful** to the revised design pack, with a
concentrated set of variances. This document records every finding so the
remaining work can be executed in small, self-contained batches without
relying on prior chat context.

## Working method (read first)
1. Each item below is independently shippable. Do them in any order within a phase.
2. For any UI item, **open the named template `.jsx`** and match structure/spacing/copy/tones exactly.
3. **Retain all performance patterns**: `React.memo` on rows/charts, `useEnsureFetched`,
   workbench prefetch, `<WorkArea>` + `<Card>` spacing, `optimizePackageImports`,
   fetch-once-via-context in workbenches.
4. Tailwind JIT cannot see interpolated class names (`bg-${tone}`) — always use
   explicit class maps.
5. Honesty rule: where the backend genuinely lacks data, render `—`/empty states
   rather than fabricating. Do NOT invent peer cross-sell items, fake renewal
   dates, etc. (these are flagged "accept as-is" below).
6. Commit per item with a descriptive message ending in the session URL.
7. Backend cannot be booted in this env (no pydantic/numpy) — verify by AST-parse
   + field-checking against `infrastructure/db/models.py`.

## ✅ COMPLETE (Phase F.0 — pure-frontend, already shipped)
- Login form alignment + brand-panel logo placement (`auth-brand-panel.tsx`, `login/layout.tsx`)
- Login + SSO submit button → template `.auth-primary` (ink fill, mint-teal edge-light on hover)
- Logo SVGs replaced with revised brand colours (`#39d3ba` / `#F1ECE0`)
- SSO + Sign-in stray "Welcome" eyebrow removed
- Profile: headline 24→32px, `max-w-5xl`→`max-w-[1280px]`, dropped extra Back button
- World Engine: tier-distribution bar chart + Emerging-scenarios + Shock-simulator row
- Broker Communications: Line filter pills + `max-w-[1100px]`→`[1400px]`

---

## PHASE F.1 — Backend enrichment: Client Workbench (`/portal/clients/{entity}`)
**Why batched:** all five CW tab gaps below are served by the SAME endpoint, so do
the schema + query work once.

**Backend** — `infrastructure/api/routes/portal/broker_intel.py` (`client_workbench`)
+ `schemas.py` (`ClientWorkbenchCoverage` / `ClientWorkbenchResponse`):
- [ ] Add per-featured-coverage **impact breakdown** (reuse `layers/risk/impact_breakdown.ImpactBreakdown`
      built from the latest MV's `modifiers_applied`) → for CW Score "Impact breakdown" bars.
- [ ] Add **`exposure_band_boundaries`** (JSONB already on `ModelVersionRecord`) to the
      coverage shape → for CW Exposure "Band boundaries" table.
- [ ] Add **`modifiers_applied`** (the full chain) to the featured coverage → for CW
      Premium "modifier build-up" 6-row table.
- [ ] Add loss **velocities + confidence + cohort name**
      (`loss_frequency_velocity`, `loss_severity_velocity`, `loss_confidence`,
      `loss_cohort_name`) → for CW Loss trajectory card + the 2 dropped KPIs.
- [ ] Add **referral message threads** per coverage (ReferralMessage rows:
      direction/body/created_at/signal_value_update) → for CW Communications bubbles.

**Frontend** — `frontend/src/types/portal.ts` (extend `ClientWorkbenchCoverage`)
+ `app/(app)/broker/clients/[entity]/`:
- [ ] **Score & Cohort** (`score/page.tsx`) — add Impact-breakdown diverging-bars card
      (template `reim_cw_b.jsx` CwScore, second card: center-axis +/- bars). Also add the
      dashed cohort-median reference line to the score-history chart. **(High)**
- [ ] **Exposure** (`exposure/page.tsx`) — replace the generic "Exposure detail" KPI grid
      with the **Band boundaries table** (Small/Mid/Large rows + ranges + modifiers, active
      band highlighted); restore the YoY KPI (was swapped for "Line"); add the 3 sub-KPIs
      under the band meter (Band percentile / Below ceiling / Above floor). **(High/Med)**
- [ ] **Premium Build-up** (`premium/page.tsx`) — render the full modifier chain
      (Base → Categorical → Signal → Direct → Loss → Exposure → Technical) with
      factor/delta/running columns, not just the 2-row Base/Technical. Add Taxes+levies /
      Distribution / Role rows to the Commercial card. **(Med)**
- [ ] **Loss Profile** (`loss/page.tsx`) — add the "Loss trajectory" card
      (Overall/Frequency/Severity prev→cur with trend arrows); restore Confidence + Cohort
      KPIs (7-KPI strip, not 6). **(Med)**
- [ ] **Communications** (`comms/page.tsx`) — render expandable message threads
      (carrier/broker chat bubbles + signal chips + timestamps), not just link rows. **(Med)**

Templates: `reim_cw_a.jsx` (CwPremium), `reim_cw_b.jsx` (CwScore/CwLoss/CwExposure),
`reim_cw_c.jsx` (CwComms).

---

## PHASE F.2 — Backend enrichment: Client portal + Broker book columns
**Backend** — `infrastructure/api/routes/portal/overview.py` + `schemas.py`:
- [ ] `ClientCoverageEntry`: add `carrier`, `limit`, `aggregate_limit`, `deductible`
      (retention), `expires_at` (or policy period end). Source from latest MV /
      RiskTerms / Quote.
- [ ] `ClientBookEntry`: add `carrier`.

**Frontend**:
- [ ] **Client · Coverages** (`app/(app)/client/coverages/page.tsx`) — `PolicyRow` from
      5 cols → 7: add **Limit/Aggregate**, **Retention**, **expiry date**; show **carrier
      name** as the bold primary label (not `submission_code`); per-line header icons
      (shield-check / file-check / users for Cyber / PI / D&O). Template `reim_coverages.jsx`. **(High)**
- [ ] **Broker · Book** (`app/(app)/broker/page.tsx`) — add the **Carrier column** to the
      roster table; add per-thread `age` to query cards. Template `reim_broker_book.jsx`. **(High/Low)**

---

## PHASE F.3 — Client Risk Insights charts
- [ ] **Client · Risk Insights** (`app/(app)/client/drivers/page.tsx`) — row 4 currently
      uses stripped StatLine cards. Restore the rich visuals to match
      `reim_drivers.jsx` row 4: the **12-quarter claims strip + Frequency/Severity
      CompareBars** (LossOutlook) and the **market-scale position strip with the YOU pin**
      (Exposure). Prefer reusing `app/(app)/client/_components/LossOutlookCard.tsx` +
      `ExposureCard.tsx`. NOTE: `ScoreResponse` lacks `loss_event_quarters` + velocities —
      either (a) extend the score endpoint, or (b) have drivers also read the overview
      `hero` coverage. Decide in-phase. **(High)**

---

## PHASE F.4 — Admin Audit Log diff
**Backend** — confirm audit events expose `before_state` / `after_state` JSON.
- [ ] **Admin · Audit Log** (`app/(app)/admin/audit/page.tsx`) — make rows **expandable**
      to reveal the before/after JSON state-diff (template `reim_admin_b.jsx` DiffPanel:
      Before = neg border, After = pos border). **(High)**

---

## PHASE F.5 — Broker Book Health metric
- [ ] **Broker · Book Health** (`app/(app)/broker/book-health/page.tsx`) — the two
      breakdown cards must show **premium-$ share** ("$XXXk (NN% · count)") not
      policy-count %, and be titled "Premium by vertical" / "Premium by coverage line"
      (currently "Policy mix by …"). Needs premium aggregation per vertical/line in the
      book-health endpoint if not already present. Template `reim_broker_health.jsx`. **(Med)**

---

## PHASE F.6 — Cosmetic / low-risk cleanup (batch last)
- [ ] **Carrier · Pipeline** (`app/(app)/carrier/page.tsx`) — convert the `%`-width
      `<table>` to fixed-px CSS grid columns matching the template
      (`2fr 1fr 1.4fr 80px 70px 100px 110px 130px 70px 150px`). **(Med, cosmetic)**
- [ ] Pipeline empty-state copy → `No submissions match "{query}".`; hero icon
      `UserCheck`→`user-star` equivalent.
- [ ] Verify Loss/Exposure scatter dots render coloured (`var(--color-pos)` tokens resolve).
- [ ] World Engine relationships table — add the "Discovered" column (8th).
- [ ] Carrier Premium Assembly — "Approver" vs "Commission total" label (template parity).
- [ ] Client Coverages / Broker Coverages — per-line header icons (not hardcoded ShieldCheck).
- [ ] Client Profile — "Joined" identity row/chip if a created-at is available.

---

## ACCEPT AS-IS (intentional deviations — do NOT "fix")
- CW Opportunities cross-sell cards → honest "connect a peer-portfolio source" note
  (no peer-portfolio table exists).
- Carrier-name nulls anywhere there is no carrier column in the DB → render `—`
  (covered once F.2 adds the field; until then acceptable).
- `fmtRelative` timestamps vs template's absolute strings.
- Profile Notifications "Coming soon" (non-persisted toggles would mislead).
- Profile hero Sign-out button retained (functional necessity on standalone account page).
- Renewal dates are synthesised only — CW Pipeline "Renews in" stays omitted until a
  real renewal-date source lands.
